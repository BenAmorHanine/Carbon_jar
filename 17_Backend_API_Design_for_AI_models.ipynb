    "**1. Core Design Principles:**\n",
    "* Resource-Oriented: The API is structured around resources (the predictions and anomaly detection jobs).\n",
    "* Stateless: Each request from a client contains all the information needed for the server to fulfill it + No client context is stored on the server between requests.\n",
    "* HTTP Methods: We will use standard HTTP verbs (GET, POST) and status codes (200 OK, 202 Accepted, 400 Bad Request, etc.) to indicate request outcomes.\n",
    "* JSON for Data Exchange: All request and response bodies will use JSON for its readability and broad support.\n",
    "* Clear Separation of Sync & Async: The API provides distinct patterns for quick, real-time predictions and for long-running, asynchronous jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. API Versioning:**\n",
    "Crucial for iterating on our API structure without breaking client implementations. We will use **URI path versioning**: /api/v1/..., /api/v2/...\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Authentication:**\n",
    "It is primordial to secure our API. I suggest using standars approaches like JWT and API Keys: The client sends a unique key in the request headers Authorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Endpoint Design: Prediction Model:**\n",
    "Like asked, we need 2 endpoints for preditions: one for synchronous (real-time) requests and one for asynchronous (batch/long-running) jobs.\n",

    "**4.1. Synchronous Prediction:**\n",
